# XOR_Python_NN
A very simple numpy implementation of a 3-layer Neural Network that learns a generic XOR pattern. Based off of Andrew Trask's "A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python" blog post:  http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/. My implementation is slightly different in that I am using Online Training and Stochastic Gradient Descent. Trask runs the entire dataset through the Network at once and takes an average error through each iteration while I am running one training example at a time through the Network and calculating the error with each example then adding up and averaging the error only after every example has been trained. This is one iteration in my network. My network also randomizes the order of the training examples at each iteration. Although my implementation takes longer to run, it produces a smaller error and better accuracy on a test set. All in all, this was a fun experiment that I learned a lot from.
